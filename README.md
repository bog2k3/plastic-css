# plastic-css
A CSS library for adding neumorphic extruded plastic style to your app

To use the styles, just link the **"pastic.css"** into your html and add the **"ps-container"** class to the **&lt;body&gt;** element.
Most elements will be styled automatically. You need to add **"ps-panel"** class on divs that you want to be raised.
See the examples for more info, the code is self explanatory.

The **plastic.js** file is required only for modal functionality.
